Bombertale is an Undertale fan-game that combines the classic game of Bomberman and combines it with the world of Undertale.

This game was orginally made as part of a networking class at UCI and was created to demonstrate our knowledge of networking and applying it to video games.

The game supports both Local and Online Multiplayer games of up to 4 different players.


## Getting Started

There is currently not a build available for download, but we hope to put one up on itch.io sometime in the near future.

For now, you will need to open our game in Unity 5.5.0f3 and build it maunally from there. The Windows Operating System is preferred as we built most code for Windows, and did not do as much bug testing for Mac builds, but the project will build for Mac as well.
